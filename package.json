(i.e. replace \"root@/\" to \"username:password@/\" as necessary)\r The server will automatically use that account to create a database called aicomp if it doesn't exist, and a table called users within if that doesn't exist either.\r It will not override existing databases and tables of those names. You may need to drop the database manually if changes occur in the schemas?",
